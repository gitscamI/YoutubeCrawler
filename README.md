# YoutubeCrawler
- crawl youtube video links
- objective: determine how many videos youtube has (very abmitious and possibly impractical, i know)
<br><br>
- some issues :
  - currently crawler is linear i.e. that is it randomly chooses a link in the crawled link list and crawls that 
  - link storage is redundant
<br><br>
- To Do:
  - use threading to increase crawling speed (how many threads to use? average id count from a link was around 20)
  - do something about redundant storage
